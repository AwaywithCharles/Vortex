# Archon - Vortex

**Archon** is a cutting-edge homelab AI/machine learning project that I am developing to create a personalized, automated assistant for managing my network, files, and projects. Using state-of-the-art AI and machine learning algorithms, Archon will help me automate routine tasks, sort and organize my files, and keep me on track with my projects and priorities.

With Archon, I am pushing the boundaries of what is possible in homelab automation, using advanced techniques like natural language processing, deep learning, and network analysis to create an intelligent, intuitive assistant that can understand and respond to my needs. By leveraging the power of modern AI and machine learning, I am able to create a truly personalized experience that adapts to my needs and preferences over time.

Archon is a passion project that represents the culmination of years of experience and expertise in the fields of AI, machine learning, homelab automation, and network management. It is a testament to the power of technology to transform the way we live and work, and to the unlimited potential of the human mind to create and innovate.

Thank you for your interest in Archon, and I look forward to sharing more updates and insights as this exciting project progresses!
